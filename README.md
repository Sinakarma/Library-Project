# Library-Project
Our project is a book library application with 2 user roles: teacher and student. Thus, teachers and students will be able to borrow and return books (5 books maximum that the teacher can keep 3 minutes each and 3 books maximum that the student can keep 2 minutes each). In addition, the teacher will have the right to add a book of his choice. Finally, each user will have his own account (login and password) that he will have to use to connect and have the rights of the role he occupies. However, if the user does not have an account, he/she will have to create one before being able to access the site.
